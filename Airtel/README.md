- Required Preparation: One should be thorough with DSA concepts and attend to all famous questions asked in interviews. I also recommend going through all the experiences of students who appeared for the whole selection process. GeeksforGeeks, GlassDoor, etc., have quite a lot of experience. From this, you can get an idea of the type of questions generally asked.

- Tips: Make your interview more interactive. Discuss your answers, and feel free to explain everything, assuming the interviewer doesn't know anything and ask him if he needs more clarification. Always play on your strengths, and if you feel the interview is going in the direction you don't know much about, honestly tell the interviewer about it. This works because interviewers don't judge you based on what you don't know but based on what you claim to know and whether you know that or not.

At last, I asked him a few questions about technologies used in Airtel, his role as a fresher, and the answer to my puzzle. My interview lasted 30 mins.

<b name = "TI2">Technical Interview - 2</b>

The interview started with my introduction, and very quickly, we jumped into the discussion about my best project. I explained my project and my role. The interviewer was pretty interested, so he asked me to show some codes used in the project and explain them. 
I shared my GitHub and explained the approaches, difficulties, and logic. I also used the whiteboard to describe strategies/reasons whenever required.

Unlike other interviews, my whole discussion was on my single project, and he was satisfied with the answers. At last, I asked him two questions.
